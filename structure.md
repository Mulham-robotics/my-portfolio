Absolutely! Your vision is clear and ambitious, aiming for a **modern, interactive, and well-organized Docusaurus-powered portfolio** that showcases your multidisciplinary skills, experiences, and projects. Here’s a brainstorming guide and preliminary structure for your site, with actionable suggestions and details for each section:

***

# Portfolio Website Structure Brainstorm

## Main Page (Homepage)

**Content:**
- **Your Name** (large, prominent)
- **Short Introduction** ("Third-year Mechatronics Engineering student, top of my class, international trainer, curriculum designer...")
- **Badges for Main Achievements/Roles:**  
  Interactive badges (logo + title) for:
  - International Physics Olympiad Trainer (DCA)
  - Kids Programming Marathon Trainer (DCA, VSU)
  - Ambassador (Astronomy & Astrophysics, Computer Science Competitions)
  - Coach (Paper Airplanes, Python/AI)
  - Curriculum Designer (HerWill)
- **Badges are clickable:**  
  Each links to a dedicated page (or grouped blog/project) detailing your work, media, or reflection (in `/docs/experiences/` or `/blog/` folders).

**Technologies Section:**
- **Grid of Cards:**  
  Cards are styled like GitHub repo tech tags, each card shows:
    - Tech logo (SVG or PNG)
    - Tech name (e.g., Python, Arduino, SolidWorks)
  - **Cards are clickable:** Each opens an article (in `/docs/technologies/tech-name/index.md`) containing:
    - Tech introduction
    - List of projects you did with it (as linked cards)
    - Each project links to a page `/docs/technologies/tech-name/project-x.md` with details, images, code, and results.

**Section: Places/Institutions Worked With:**
- Logos and names for organizations (DCA, VSU, Paper Airplanes, HerWill)
- Badges/clickable links to pages describing your partnership, contributions, photos, certificates, media, etc.

***

## Docs Section

- `/docs/technologies/`  
  Folder for each technology:
    - `/docs/technologies/python/introduction.md`
    - `/docs/technologies/python/projects/classifier.md`
    - `/docs/technologies/arduino/robot-arm.md`
- Each tech's **index.md** contains:
  - Short intro
  - List of projects (with images or icons)
  - Tech-specific achievements

- `/docs/experiences/`
  - Detailed writeups on major roles, e.g.:
    - `/docs/experiences/physics-olympiad.md`
    - `/docs/experiences/herwill-design.md`
  - These can be grouped if needed ("Coaching", "Ambassador Roles", "Curriculum Design", etc.)

***

## Blog Section

- `/blog/` folder contains:
  - Opinion pieces, personal essays, updates, guides.
  - Random thoughts or articles that may later become project docs.

- **Blogs are searchable and categorized by tags.**
- Later, a blog can be "promoted" to a full project-page or linked from technology docs.

***

## Project Details Hierarchy

- Every major project has its own page under the technology it connects to:
  - `/docs/technologies/python/project-xyz.md`
  - `/docs/technologies/solidworks/mechanism.md`
- Project pages contain:
  - Title, description, timeline, outcome, images/screenshots, code snippets, and links.
  - Backlink to technology and main page.

- **Projects in experiences:**  
  If a project is part of an experience (e.g., coaching a championship), its page links to both the technology and the experience section.

***

## Inspiration for UI Elements

- **Cards and Badges:**  
  Use Docusaurus’ [custom CSS](https://docusaurus.io/docs/styling-layout) to style cards. Use SVG icons/logos for crisp, consistent look.
- **Clickable elements:**  
  Use `<Link>` from Docusaurus for fast navigation, wrap badges and cards.

- **Sidebar and Navbar:**  
  Docs sidebar for tech/project navigation.
  Navbar for: Home, Technologies, Experiences, Blog.

- **Search and Tags:**  
  Enable Docusaurus search for easy navigation across projects and blogs.
  Use tags (e.g., "AI", "Education", "Olympiad") for filtering blog and project posts.

## Recommendations & Next Steps

- Sketch out your homepage layout: decide the order of sections (intro, badges, tech, organizations).
- Collect SVG/PNG logos for all techs and organizations.
- List all techs you want covered and start draft introductions and project lists.
- Collect media (photos, certificates, project screenshots, etc.).
- Map roles/achievements to badges and decide how to group their pages.
- Write your first project doc and first experience doc as a template.
